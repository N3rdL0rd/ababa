- A phoneme is either A-type, B-type, or neutral
	- A-type: Soft sound, vowel
	- B-type: Hard sound, consonant
	- Neutral fills the place of either, with conditional pronunciation based on its place in the word (depending on the phoneme)
		- Some phonemes are neutral but *special*, such as "/" or "Y" - they have specific meanings as special [[modifier]]s.
		- Note that "~" and "!" are the same sound, but are separate for the sake of clarity - ""
