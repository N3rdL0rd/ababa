#### *Verb*, *Subject*, (*Object*)
Subject can be omitted if you are talking about doing an action yourself, but only if there is no object.

## Phonemes

- A phoneme is either A-type, B-type, or neutral
	- A-type: Soft sound, vowel
	- B-type: Hard sound, consonant
	- Neutral fills the place of either, with conditional pronunciation based on its place in the word

| Type | Sound         | Notation |
| ---- | ------------- | -------- |
| N    | L (B)/Luh (A) | L        |
| N    | Click (Tsk)   | !        |
| N    | Click (Tsk)   | ~        |
| N    | Huh           | /        |

## Words

Words follow a pattern of either ABAB or BABA. A word is considered to be A-leading if it begins with an A phoneme, and vice versa for B-leading.
Pairs of words that have opposite meanings should be of opposite leading phonemes and of similar composition otherwise.
Words can fall into any of:
- Noun
- Verb
### Nouns
- I/Me: A
- You: H
- That/It: L
	- Note that when ending a sentence with the L phoneme, you should pronounce it as A-type, even if it is playing a B-type role in a word.
- We: HA
- This language: ABB
	- Note that this is the **only** word permitted to violate the rule of ABAB/BABA ordering.
- Human being: QH
- Dignity: ESA
- Rights(as in human rights): ZA
- Money: HL
### Noun Categories

- Sustenance (Food & Water): BG
- Animal: LE
	- Aquatic: Z
		- Eel: Q
- Vehicle: HZ
	- Watercraft: Z
		- Hovercraft: K
### Verbs

- To move: ZP
- To be stupid or idiotic (as of a person): PAC
- To be stupid or useless (as of an object): PACA
- To enjoy/find interesting: KP
- To articulate: QCA
- To consume: BE
- To perceive (consume with eyes): BESK
- To contain: SLB
- To exist: ZW
- To know but to be unable to articulate: GPQ
- To be in a state of selection paralysis: QWE
- To be born: DH
- To die: HD
- To be free (as in "speech"): OGS
- To be free (as in "beer"): GOS
- To be free (as in open-source, "libre"): SGO
- To be equal (with others): SQQ
	- When an object is specified with SQQ, it is "to be equal with others in this respect", not "to be equal with"
- To be equal with: SQK
	- 
## Modifiers

A modifier is a sequence of phonemes prepended to a word that changes its meaning in some capacity. This is similar to adjectives (or predicates, which are, ***ahem***, lame) in other (more inferior) languages. Modifiers are denoted (in parentheses) before the word.

- I did/Affirmative: S
- I did not/Negative: K
- Correctly: B
- Incorrectly: Z
- In the future: C
- In the past: Q
- Early in the day (breakfast/morning): LA
- Middle of the day (lunch/noon): LZ
- Late in the day (dinner/night): LQ
- Question: SL
	- You can question any part of a sentence - the verb, the subject, the object, etc. For instance:
	- (SL)PAC A:
		- Am I ***stupid***? (Questioning verb)
	- PAC (SL)A:
		- Am ***I*** stupid? (Questioning subject)
	- (Z)QCA H (SL)L:
		- You spelled ***it*** wrong? (Questioning object)
- Near: GH
- Far: HG
- Big: GW
- Small: WG
- Minimum: SQ
- Maximum: QS
- Multiple of: GL
- Ownership: GHK:
	- After the ownership modifier, specify a noun that is the owner of the word being modified. For instance:
		- HZ{Z-K}: The hovercraft
		- (GHK A)HZ{Z-K}: ***My*** hovercraft
			- Note that A is the noun for "me"
- Disapproving: !!!
	- Disapproves of any word. For instance:
		- (!!!)ZW H
			- I disapprove of your existence.
		- (QS-!!!)ZW A
			- I maximally disapprove of (hate/detest) my existence.
			- Or: I hate my life.
- Surprised: BA
	- Slur the B and A so it sounds like "Bah!"
- Foreign language: Y
	- Specifies that the following word will be in a different language. Use the noun corresponding to the language in the language of origin after this qualifier to specify language. If you do not specify a language, it may be inferred or assumed to be Klingon. For example:
		- (Y English)Antidisestablishmentarianism
			- Interpreted as English
		- (Y) lupDujHomwIj luteb gharghmey
			- Interpreted as Klingon by default

Unless specified with a conjunction, modifiers modify each other from left to right. For example:

- QS-!!!: Stacking, QS modifies !!! for maximum disapprovement
- QS~!!!: Nonstacking, QS and !!! both modify the attached word
## Conjunction

~ (Click) - Conjunction AND. Equivalent to ~~English~~ objectively inferior languages. Use as:

- (GL~GW)
	- Multiple big
- ZP~BE A BG
	- I am moving while consuming sustenance

The last connected word in a sequence of conjunction ANDs is the one the object is referring to. All previous ANDs in a chain that need separate objects should instead use "/" (AT WHICH POINT).
%% TODO: better conjugation for immediate and connecting two sentences %%

/ (Huh) - Conjugation AT WHICH POINT. Used to connect multiple sentences.
## Qualifiers

A qualifier is a sequence of phonemes appended to a **noun** (just nouns, (K)PAC H!) that specifies a sub-item of a larger category. For instance, you could say the word for "animal" (LE), then a qualifier for a category - say, "aquatic" (Z), then a specific animal - say, "eel" (Q). Qualifiers are denoted {in braces} after the word, and nested qualifiers are denoted by nesting braces.
