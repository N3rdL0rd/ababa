		- I am moving while consuming sustenance
- / (Huh) - Conjunction AT WHICH POINT. Use as:
	- ZP A / BE A BG

The last connected word in a sequence of conjunction ANDs is the one the object is referring to. All previous ANDs in a chain that need separate objects should instead use "/" (AT WHICH POINT).
