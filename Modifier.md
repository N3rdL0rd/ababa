A modifier is a sequence of phonemes prepended to a word that changes its meaning in some capacity. This is similar to adjectives (or predicates, which are, ***ahem***, lame) in other (more inferior) languages. Modifiers are denoted (in parentheses) before the word.

Unless specified with a conjunction, modifiers modify each other from left to right. For example:

- QS-!!!: Stacking, QS modifies !!! for maximum disapprovement
- QS~!!!: Nonstacking, QS and !!! both modify the attached word
