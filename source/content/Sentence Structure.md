At its core:
#### *Verb*, *Subject*, (*Object*)

Subject can be omitted if you are talking about doing an action yourself, but only if there is no object. A [[modifier]] can be prepended to any part of a sentence in (parentheses). A [[qualifier]] can be appended to any part of a sentence in {braces} - subsequent sub-qualifiers can be {nested{in{one{another}}}}.

Any part of a sentence can also be alternately replaced with a [[conjunction]]. The "/" conjugation can also be used to connect two sentences, as in "at which point". For instance:

- *Sentence 1 / Sentence 2*
	- Becomes:
		- *Sentence 1*, at which point, *Sentence 2*

An example of a sentence with English words could be:
- (In the past)Eat Me Food{Burger}
	- This can be rearranged to:
		- *I ate a burger.*
