Welcome! We, the communal creators of ABABA, are immensely overjoyed that you, one of those who speak one of the many objectively inferior languages of the world, have decided to set down your birth (or even learned) language and learn ABABA, the objectively superior language.

[[index|ABABA]] is a constructed language that aims to keep core syntax as effectively lightweight and compact as possible, while still maintaining a high capacity for emergent complexity. Some highlights of major differences from English:

- [[List of Verbs|All verbs]] are indefinite present-tense.
- [[Modifier|Modifiers]] can be prepended to any word in ABABA to change its meaning in some regard
	- For instance, you can take an unmodified verb (which is always indefinite present-tense) and modify it to be "in the past" (*Q*), making the modified form behave as past-tense.
- Emotions are expressed as verbs, as in: "To be in a state of".
- [[Sentence Structure|Sentence structure]] stays almost constant (with the exception of conjunctions)
- Consistent phonetical rules - everything is always pronounced the same, regardless of context
- ***No conjugations, ever!*** Guaranteed or your money back!

So, without any further ado, let's dive in!
## Phonology

The [[Phonology]] page has a good in-depth look at the phonetics of ABABA, but we're here for a cursory look - just enough to be able to speak the language. The most critical thing to remember is:

***All words follow an A-B-A-B or B-A-B-A pattern of phonemes.***

Wait, what the hell does that mean? It's actually relatively simple:
- Every phoneme in ABABA has a *type*.
- This *type* is any of A, B, or neutral.
	- A-type phonemes are a softer, more vowel-y sound
	- B-type phonemes are harder sounds, more like consonant
- A word cannot<sup>1</sup> use two A-type or B-type phonemes in a row.
	- Instead, it must alternate between the two.
	- A word also cannot use two of the same neutral phoneme in a row.

## Basic Sentence Structure

Formally speaking, a sentence follows the structure of:

> (Modifier)*Verb*, (Modifier)*Subject*(Qualifier), (\[Modifier\]*Object*\[Qualifier\])

Whoa! That's a mouthful right there. Can we break this down? Well, at its core, this is really just:

> *Verb*, *Subject*, (*Object*)

So let's start there. Let's say I wanted to say "I am happy" with this sentence structure. We can rearrange as so, remembering our rules about verb tenses from earlier:

> *In a state of being happy*, *Me*

In this sentence, *Me*, the subject, is *in a state of being happy*. So, how would we change this to be past-tense, if all verbs are indefinite present-tense? This leads us into...

## Modifiers

[[Modifier|Modifiers]] are sequences of phonemes that are prepended to a word to change its meaning. You can see a list of them [[List of Modifiers|here]], but the one we care about right now is:

- *In the past: Q*

Notice that *Q* is the actual phonemic transcription of the modifier itself, as it is articulated in ABABA. For the sake of our current examples in English, we can just use *In the past*. If we prepend that modifier to the previous sentence, we can now translate "I was happy" to our pseudo-ABABA:

> (In the past)In a state of being happy, Me

## Qualifiers

Now, let's move on to another feature of ABABA - [[Qualifier|qualifiers]] and [[List of Nouns#Qualified Nouns|qualified nouns]]. Sometimes, you'll find yourself with a large category of nouns that is very difficult to fully specify - or maybe you'll find yourself with the need to specify a larger category of a noun without being able to remember what it is. ABABA solves these problems with *qualifiers*, which qualify a noun's meaning into hierarchical subcategories. Let's take the sentence "My hovercraft is full of eels" as an example. In fully untranslated ABABA, that is:

> (QS)SLB (GHK A)HZ{Z{K}} (GL)LE{Z{Q}}

Let's translate to our pseudo-ABABA English, as we had it before:

> (Maximum)Contains (Owned by me)Vehicle{Watercraft{Hovercraft}} Animal{Aquatic{Eel}} 

The qualifiers in this sentence are the words enclosed by {braces} - and now, as you read this, the image should become much clearer. By removing any of the subqualifiers, we can change the meaning of the sentence:

> (Maximum)Contains (Owned by me)Vehicle{Watercraft} Animal{Aquatic}

This means "My watercraft is full of aquatic animals". Basically, qualifiers work at a basic overarching category and iteratively refine the meaning of the word to a specific meaning by traversing hierarchical categories.

## Going from pseudo-ABABA to the real thing

Now, here's the hardest part. We need to make the leap from our English approximation of ABABA to the real deal. I personally thing the best way to do this is to study the [[Phrasebook]], the [[List of Verbs]] and the [[List of Nouns]], and try to understand what phrases from the Phrasebook mean without reading the translations. Once you get a semi-firm grasp on the vocabulary of ABABA, move on to the next section.
## Advanced Sentence Structure

In this section, we're going to walk through, step by step, translating the first article of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights) from English to ABABA. This article reads<sup>2</sup>:

> "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."

First, let's break this up into individual thoughts:

- All human beings are born, at which point:
	- They are free
	- They are equal in dignity and rights

We're going to craft each of these sentences separately, then connect them with conjunctions, which are a new concept in this brief introduction to ABABA. Let's start with the first clause:

> "All human beings are born"

Let's begin with the verb. "To be born" translates to *DH* (roughly pronounced "Duh-Ooh"). However, this is an indefinite present tense verb - we need to add a modifier for past tense. This is *Q* (pronounced "Qwuh"). This gives us:

> (Q)DH

Now, let's translate the subject. We can begin with the noun for "human being", *QH* (pronounced "Qwuh-Ooh"), but we need to specify that this applies to **all** human beings - we have a few options:

- The "multiple of" modifier (*GL*, "Guh-Luh")
- The "maximum of" modifier (*QS*, "Qwuh-Suh")

But... which to choose? And here comes yet another ABABA principle:

***Modifiers can modify each other!***

When multiple modifiers are strung in a row, they modify one another in a linear fashion. For example:

- (GL~GW):
	- GL (multiple of) *and* GW (big) - both modifiers apply independently to the target word
- (GL-GW) translates to:
	- GL (multiple of) GW (big) - modifiers apply from left to right on top of one another - there are multiple of the modifier "big"

Now, let's apply this to our running problem - to say "all human beings", we can use the conjunction "AND" (*~*), to apply both "multiple of" and "maximum of" to the noun, "human being". This is:

> (QS-GL)QH

Putting the pieces together, we get our first complete clause:

> (Q)DH (QS-GL)QH

This means "all human beings are born". Now, we need to articulate "at which point", and define the meaning of human rights in of itself. We need the following verbs:

- To be free (as in "speech"): OGS
- To be equal (with others): SQQ

The noun for "it" (as in referring to something previously referenced or defined) is *L*. So, combining this:

> OGS ~ SQQ L

This means "they \[all human beings\] are free (as in 'speech') and equal (with others)". Now, we need to articulate particularly which aspects human beings are equal in, being the following nouns:

- Dignity: ESA
- Rights (as in human rights): ZA

Note that when using a conjunction to join two verbs, the object only applies to the last verb in the chain. So, *OGS ~ SQQ L ESA* doesn't mean the same thing as *SQQ ~ OGS L ESA*. We can create the following clause by using the "AND" conjunction on *ESA* and *ZA*:

> OGS ~ SQQ L ESA ~ ZA

Finally, we can put it all together with the "AT WHICH POINT" conjugation, */*, and finally, we get:

> (Q)DH (QS-GL)QH / OGS ~ SQQ L ESA ~ ZA

## Conclusion

Hopefully by reading and following along with this brief introduction to ABABA you've gained a fundamental understanding of the principle of the language. Because ABABA is still very young, especially in the context of languages, there *will* be issues - please help us out and [contribute on Github](https://github.com/N3rdL0rd/ababa)!
## Footnotes

1. The self-referential word for ABABA (the language itself) in ABABA is phonetized as "ABB". It is the only word allowed to break the A-B-A-B pattern rule.
2. There is a second sentence to this article, but it is much more complex and the first sentence serves well to illustrate certain concepts of ABABA.
