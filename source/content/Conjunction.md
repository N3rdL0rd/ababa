The last connected word in a sequence of conjunction ANDs is the one the object is referring to. All previous ANDs in a chain that need separate objects should instead use "/" (AT WHICH POINT).

Conjunctions may also be applied to [[Modifier|modifiers]] to combine their meanings instead of modifying each other.
