A qualifier is a sequence of phonemes appended to a **noun** (just nouns, (K)PAC H!) that specifies a sub-item of a larger category.

For instance, you could say the word for "animal" (LE), then a qualifier for a category - say, "aquatic" (Z), then a specific animal - say, "eel" (Q). Qualifiers are denoted {in braces} after the word, and nested qualifiers are denoted by nesting braces.
