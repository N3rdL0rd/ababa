Words follow a pattern of either ABAB or BABA. A word is considered to be A-leading if it begins with an A phoneme, and vice versa for B-leading.
Pairs of words that have opposite meanings should be of opposite leading phonemes and of similar composition otherwise.
Words can fall into any of:
- Noun
- Verb
